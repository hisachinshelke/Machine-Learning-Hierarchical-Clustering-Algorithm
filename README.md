# Machine-Learning-Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm
Machine Learning: Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm
I have developed a Machine Learning Algorithm that can analyze and predict the customer's spending pattern.
It is implemented using Aggolomerative Clustering algorithm based on Hierarchical Clustering.
To prepare train and test the model, a sythesized dataset contianing customer's spending data was taken.It contained customer details like customer's average monthly expenditure, visits made by customer, type of products customer purchased, etc.
While model creation, also applied scaling on data so as to have homoginity in data. Used Z-Score for normalization.
Observations (distribution) were plotted using Kernel Density Estimators (KDEs) plots for better visual representations.
Finally I have used Dendograms to visualize the result of a hierarchical clustering.
Cophenetic correlation index achived = 0.868
